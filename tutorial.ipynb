    "\n",
    "For convenience, we will assume properties known as Extensionality (EXT) and Conservativity (CONS) (see SEP for these definitions).  Together, these say that only the sets $A \\cap B$ and $A \\ B$ are relevant to the truth of a quantifier.  We can thus represent a model $\\mathcal{M}$ by encoding whether each object in $M$ belongs to $A \\cap B$ (in which case we will call it a $1$) or to $A \\setminus B$ (in which case we will call it a $0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, every model of size $n$ can be encoded as an $n$-dimensional vector of bits.  Conversely, every $n$-bit vector corresponds to a model $\\mathcal{M}$.  (Subtle caveat: this correspondence requires an enumeration of $M$.  See the above paper for discussion.)\n",
